        <p>
          Lightbox is a JavaScript library that displays images and videos by filling the screen, and dimming out the rest of the web page.[1]
        </p>

        <p>
          The original JavaScript library was written by Lokesh Dhakar with the help of riphath.[2] The term Lightbox may also refer to other similar JavaScript libraries. The technique gained widespread popularity due to its simple and elegant style.
        </p>

        <p>
          The original Lightbox library used two JavaScript libraries, Prototype Javascript Framework[3] and script.aculo.us,[4] for its animations and positioning. In April 2012, the plugin was rewritten for jQuery.[5] The open-source nature of Lightbox encouraged developers to modify and fork the code, resulting in plugins such as Colorbox, Magnific Popup, Slimbox or Thickbox.

        <p>
          Lightbox scripts are dependent upon a browser's JavaScript support,.[6] Many Lightbox scripts use unobtrusive JavaScript. Browsers that do not load the script for whatever reason can instead simply load the image as a separate page load, losing the Lightbox effect but still retaining the ability to display the image.[7]

        <h3>Bypassing</h3>
        <p>
          The user may use a developer tool such as Chrome's Inspect Element, to remove and add the code for it from the DOM. [8] Adblock Plus as an example, has the ability to block these elements using Element Hiding Helper or manually written rules. [9]
